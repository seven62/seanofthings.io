# Initial Commit!

Ever thought to yourself, "Man, I should really write some of the things I do (and 
learn along the way) down sometime!" Well I did. And I had the same thought over and 
over for years now... So welcome to just another blog, by yet another nerd.

## Focus

I'm a _polyglot_. And a bit of a luddite when given the opportunity... which is ironic as 
I love building things with technology and have done so as a career for a long 
time now. This site will focus on just as many analog things as digital.

## Workflow

This blog will live entirely in a git repo, published via continuous delivery tools, and 
comments via github issues. This will most likely be the first subject matter! Baby steps...
